# UWC
A batch file that simulates CMD inside CMD.
Oh god what have i done...
The CMD is custom made by Me (Ofc)

# Why did i make this?
ngl i was bored and since i dont have a vm anymore

# !!! READ THIS !!!
An null file is created when running UWC.
Ignore that.
This batch file uses NULL to make pause, timeout.
You can edit whatever you want.
Please dont put IF or send IF command on UWC.
It makes it crash.
